Content of the project:

Basic Jupyter Lectures on Python Programming for Undergraduate Chemistry Courses and Labs

* **Introduction**: covers basic programming strategies, assignments, conditionals, loops, formatting, and plotting
* **Errors**: covers concepts on measurement errors, some basic statistics (binomial and normal distributions), error propagation, reading files, Pandas dataframes, and linear regression with Sklearn

Assignments:
* **Python Worksheet**: four tasks on error analysis, basic math on a dataset, more advanced operations on the columns of a dataset, and linear regression fit.

Datafiles used in the notebooks:
* test.csv: absorbance  vs. time data collected in a kinetic experiment
* protein.csv: atomic properties (element, environ descriptors, coordinates, mass, distance from center of mass) of atoms in a small protein
